# Node-Red-Rotator-Control
Node-Red Rotator Controller Flow

There are 2 flows as part of this code and written by N6RU.  

You will have to make sure your Serial ports are correct and that the actual
commands being sent to rotator are correctly formatted.  Not all DCU-1 code is the 
same (surprise).


Requirements:


Node-Red Dashboard node-red-dashboard and node-red-node-serialport
MQTT Server - ensure your IP addresses are correct
